# Text-based Monopoly Again - Patel's Version
### Just a newer version made by @patelheet30

Hopefully an improvement to TextopolyAgain by James so he can use to improve his code. No guarantee.

Fun fact: Most people are missing the point of Monopoly (@patelheet30 defo misses the point of Monopoly. I'm just coding)
